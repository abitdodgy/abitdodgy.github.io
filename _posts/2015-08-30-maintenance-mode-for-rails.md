title: Adding a dynamic maintenance mode to a Rails app
---

During the past month we've been busy introducing new features and making changes to our application, Nimbus Work Spaces. On a few occasions we needed to temporarily disable access to the application while we carried out migrations and tests. The first couple of times we disabled access with a controller `before_action` that redirected to a maintenance page unless the current user id was whitelisted. But it soon became clear that having a proper and scalable maintenance strategy is necessary.

There are several ways to implement a maintenance mode, but they typically work by bypassing requests to the application server and serving a static HTML page instead. Heroku has a built-in [maintenace feature][1] that works in a similar way, for example. Unfortuntely such solutions aren't dynamic, and thus fail our requirements. We want to:

1. Allow access to some users while the application is in maintenance mode.
2. Serve a custom, internationalized template.

This means the requests must hit the application so that it can determine how to handle the request, and what language to serve to the user. We implemented this feature by adding a controller action that rendered the maintenance template. We used Rail's built in I18n for internationalization. Maintenance mode was then enabled and disabled by setting and unsetting an `ENV` variable respectively.

{% highlight ruby %}
class DowntimeController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :check_maintenance_mode

  def show
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

The only code of interest here is the `skip_before_action` call; it ensures that we don't check for maintenance mode when we are viewing the maintenance page. This stops the application from going into an infinite loop.

We also added a concern to handle the logic, and mixed it into `application_controller.rb`.

{% highlight ruby %}
module MaintenanceMode
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    before_action :check_maintenance_mode
  end

private

  def check_maintenance_mode
    if maintenance_mode?
      redirect_to maintenance_path unless permitted_ip?
    end
  end

  def maintenance_mode?
    ENV['MAINTENANCE_MODE']
  end

  def permitted_ip?
    maintainer_ips.split(',').include?(request.remote_ip)
  end

  def maintainer_ips
    ENV['MAINTAINER_IPS'] || String.new
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include MaintenanceMode
end
{% endhighlight %}

This module adds a `before_action` that checks if the application is in maintenance mode, and does any work required.

The feature is now complete. To use it, and enter maintenance mode, we set an `ENV` variable on Heroku.

{% highlight text %}
heroku config:set MAINTENANCE_MODE=enabled
{% endhighlight %}

It doesn't really matter what the value of `MAINTENANCE_MODE` is (or its name, for that matter), so *enabled* serves for clarity. The logic checks for the presence of the variable, not its value.

If we want to allow access to a specific IP address we set another `ENV` variable. Its value should be a coma-delimited list of any IP address that we want to enable access for.

{% highlight text %}
heroku config:set MAINTAINER_IPS=1.2.3.4,9.8.7.6
{% endhighlight %}

And finally, to exit maintenance mode.

{% highlight text %}
heroku config:unset MAINTENANCE_MODE
{% endhighlight %}

Our module is also very easy to test.

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'test_helper'

class MaintenanceModeTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  setup do
    ENV['MAINTENANCE_MODE'] = 'enabled'
    ENV['MAINTAINER_IPS'] = '1.2.3.4'
  end

  teardown do
    ENV.delete('MAINTENANCE_MODE')
    ENV.delete('MAINTAINER_IPS')
  end

  test "redirects to maintenance path when in maintenance mode" do
    get root_path
    assert_redirected_to maintenance_path
  end

  test "does not redirect to maintenance path when IP is whitelisted" do
    get root_path, {}, { 'REMOTE_ADDR' => '1.2.3.4' }
    assert_equal root_path, path
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

And there it is, a flexible and dynamic maintenance mode for your Rails application.
