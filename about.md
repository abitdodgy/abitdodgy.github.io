title: Hi, I'm Mohamad
---

I'm a <del>part-time hero, full-time superstar</del> dad, lifelong student, and a developer living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I am co-founder at Aerogami, a development studio, where I am building Maestru, a project management application for construction and construction management companies.

I'm originally from [Baalbak][1], [Lebanon][2], although when I lived there I did so in [Beirut][4]. When I was twelve years old I moved to [London][5], England. I was born in Wari, [Nigeria][6]. I went to university and worked in [Boston][3] for a few years.

I love programming, and learning programming languages. I work mostly in Ruby, and Ruby on Rails, which means I work with SCSS, CoffeeScript, and JavaScript, as well as Redis and Postgresql. I've dabbled in C and Objective-C. I still dabble in Swift and Elixir. I worked for a few years in ColdFusion. I spend most of my days thinking about, designing, improving, and progamming Maestru, our product.

When I find some spare time I like to play [football][10] and read about science, especially [astronomy][8] and [biology][7], and fiction. I'm a bit of a [news junkie][9]. Although these days much of my reading time is spent on technical material.

I like cooking, especially for other people. I make an excellent [hummus][12], and, so I've been told, a great [sfiha][11].

I love to travel. But hey, who doesn't? I've been lucky to have done a lot of it in my life, but not nearly enough. Sometimes by choice, other times [because it was best to][13].

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you found something useful while you were here.
